# Feature Planning

Create a new plan to implement the `Feature` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files.

## Variables
issue_number: $1
adw_id: $2
issue_json: $3
plan_file_path: $4

## Instructions

- **OPTIONAL: Read `.adw-context.json` from the worktree root** if available for additional context:
  - `worktree_path` - worktree location (if in isolated worktree)
  - `backend_port`, `frontend_port` - application URLs
  - Context file may not exist for planning phase - that's OK
- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to implement a net new feature based on the `Feature` that will add value to the application.
- IMPORTANT: The `Feature` describes the feature that will be implemented but remember we're not implementing a new feature, we're creating the plan that will be used to implement the feature based on the `Plan Format` below.
- Create the plan file at: `{plan_file_path}` (this path is pre-computed for you - use it exactly as provided)
- Use the `Plan Format` below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase to understand existing patterns, architecture, and conventions before planning the feature.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to implement the feature successfully.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the feature requirements, design, and implementation approach.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- Design for extensibility and maintainability.
- If you need a new library, use `uv add` and be sure to report it in the `Notes` section of the `Plan Format`.
- Don't use decorators. Keep it simple.
- IMPORTANT: If the feature includes UI components or user interactions:
  - Add a task in the `Step by Step Tasks` section to create a separate E2E test file in `.claude/commands/e2e/test_<descriptive_name>.md` based on examples in that directory
  - Add E2E test validation to your Validation Commands section
  - IMPORTANT: When you fill out the `Plan Format: Relevant Files` section, add an instruction to read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, and `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` to understand how to create an E2E test file. List your new E2E test file to the `Plan Format: New Files` section.
  - To be clear, we're not creating a new E2E test file, we're creating a task to create a new E2E test file in the `Plan Format` below
- Respect requested files in the `Relevant Files` section.
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file.

## Relevant Files

Focus on the following files:
- `README.md` - Contains the project overview and instructions.
- `app/server/**` - Contains the codebase server.
- `app/client/**` - Contains the codebase client.
- `scripts/**` - Contains the scripts to start and stop the server + client.
- `adws/**` - Contains the AI Developer Workflow (ADW) scripts.

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Read `.claude/references/code_quality_standards.md` - File/function length limits, naming conventions, refactoring guidelines
- Read `.claude/references/typescript_standards.md` - TypeScript-specific type organization and patterns

- Read `.claude/commands/conditional_docs.md` to check if your task requires additional documentation
- If your task matches any of the conditions listed, include those documentation files in the `Plan Format: Relevant Files` section of your plan

Ignore all other files in the codebase.

## Plan Format

```md
# Feature: <feature name>

## Metadata
issue_number: `{issue_number}`
adw_id: `{adw_id}`
issue_json: `{issue_json}`

## Feature Description
<describe the feature in detail, including its purpose and value to users>

## User Story
As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>

## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this feature addresses>

## Solution Statement
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it solves the problem>

## Files to Modify
**CRITICAL: This section defines file scope boundaries for cost optimization.**
**List EVERY file that needs to be modified (existing files) or created (new files).**
**The implementation phase will ONLY load these files - unlisted files will NOT be accessible.**

### Existing Files
<List ALL existing files that will be modified, using absolute paths from project root. Example:
- app/server/routes/workflow_routes.py - Add new endpoint for status
- app/client/src/components/WorkflowCard.tsx - Update UI to show status
- app/server/tests/test_workflow_routes.py - Add test for new endpoint
>

### New Files
<List ALL new files that will be created. Example:
- app/server/services/workflow_status_service.py - New service for workflow status
- app/client/src/types/workflow-status.types.ts - Type definitions for status
>

## Relevant Files
Use these files for context and understanding (will NOT be loaded during implementation unless listed in "Files to Modify"):

<find and list the files that are relevant to understanding the feature but won't be directly modified. Describe why they are relevant in bullet points.>

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation
<describe the foundational work needed before implementing the main feature>

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
<describe the main implementation work for the feature>

### Phase 3: Integration
<describe how the feature will integrate with existing functionality>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to implement the feature. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required then move on to the specific implementation. Include creating tests throughout the implementation process.>

<If the feature affects UI, include a task to create a E2E test file (like `.claude/commands/e2e/test_basic_query.md` and `.claude/commands/e2e/test_complex_query.md`) as one of your early tasks. That e2e test should validate the feature works as expected, be specific with the steps to demonstrate the new functionality. We want the minimal set of steps to validate the feature works as expected and screen shots to prove it if possible.>

<Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.>

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
<describe unit tests needed for the feature>

### Edge Cases
<list edge cases that need to be tested>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the feature is implemented correctly with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors so be specific about what you want to run to validate the feature works as expected. Include commands to test the feature end-to-end.>

<If you created an E2E test, include the following validation step: `Read .claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute your new E2E `.claude/commands/e2e/test_<descriptive_name>.md` test file to validate this functionality works.>

### Code Quality Validation
- `cd app/server && uv run ruff check` - Validate Python code quality standards
- `cd app/client && bun run lint` - Validate TypeScript code quality standards
- Verify no files exceed 800 lines (hard limit)
- Verify no functions exceed 300 lines (hard limit)

### Functional Validation
- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- `cd app/client && bun tsc --noEmit` - Run frontend type checking to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- `cd app/client && bun run build` - Run frontend build to validate the feature works with zero regressions

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes, future considerations, or context that are relevant to the feature that will be helpful to the developer>
```

## Feature
Extract the feature details from the `issue_json` variable (parse the JSON and use the title and body fields).

## Report

- IMPORTANT: Return exclusively the path to the plan file created and nothing else.
